<<if $hasSketchbook and $hasBusinessCard and $hasPaints is true>>
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Don't mind me, I'm just casually thinking about how my mother's ghost is haunting me.
I just wish I knew where my sketchbook was...
and had art supplies...
and got my mother's publishing contact.
Easy, right?

<<if $harperQuest is true>>
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
WHAT? How did you get all this?
<<setSpeaker MC>>
They were in your mother's place.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Are you sure she wanted me to have this?
<<setSpeaker MC>>
These belong you to you. I promise.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Seeing that she left these, a part of me feels like she's still here with me.
Thank you.
<<endif>>

<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Ahh! You scared me. I didn't expect anyone to be here.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Sorry if I startled you. I'm new to this area.
Are you Delilah Anderson's daughter?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
My name is Harper. But yes, I am.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Harper...hi. How are you?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Ugh, did my dad set you up to this?
I told him I'm fine.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
No-
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Sure, my mom just died, but I don't need random strangers asking how I am.
No offense.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I don't know who your dad is.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
...Oh.
Sorry, my dad's been trying to get me a therapist.
And no one lives near here, so I thought he set you up.
You don't know who I am. This is weird now.
<<setSpeaker>>
[[It's a little weird.|weird]]
[[People tell me being a "friendly exorcist" is weird too, but here I am. I wouldn't worry about it.|worry]]

<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Well...I'm going to go now.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
No! Wait, I'm here to help your family. Your mom specifically.
Have you noticed something off about this place?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
My mom died here, so yeah, this place feels off.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Something that cannot be explained with grief.
Have you heard the screams too?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
...Dad told me it was the wind.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
You think wind can make that sort of noise?

If what you're saying is true, then this is really freaky.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Are you close with your mom?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Sort of? We were when I was younger but not as much anymore.
Why did you come here?
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I'm here because there's something missing from your relationship with your mother.
I saw your her ghost. She appeared after I saw a picture of your family.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
What. The. Hell.
I write children's books for crying out loud.
I do not want to be haunted by my dead mother.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
So you're both writers.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
My mom would kill you if she heard you say that.
She never considered me a writer.
Children's books weren't sophisticated enough, apparently.
She was the esteemed, recluse author. Sylvia Plath type.

My favorite story I wrote is about a raccoon who shares a den with her mother for their first winter.
The raccoon wonders if she can provide for herself like her mother has for her,
but she finds herself after "moving out."
It's only somewhat of a self-insert, I promise.

Our last conversation was an argument.
I told her I didn't want to write poetry anymore.

She doesn't understand how serious I am.
Her publisher began accepting submissions for children's books,
but she refused to give me her contact.
I even started learning art so I could do the illustrations in my book.
That said, have you seen a sketchbook anywhere? I can't find mine.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I haven't.
What made you want to write children's books?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
I grew up around metaphors that made no sense to me.
I like children's books because they aren't trying to be something they're not.
When I was young, I read this book called <i>Trading Faces</i> â€”
it's about twins who switch places, and I was obsessed with it.
I had this revelation; books can be fun?
They didn't have to follow rigid poetic structure?
I knew then that this was what I wanted to write.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Does your mother know this?
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
My mother was the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize winner.
I'm her daughter.
That's my place in the world: Delilah Anderson's offspring.
She didn't have time to care about me even if she wanted to.
I just wanted the contact.
I wanted to show her I could be successful too, in my own way.
I'm sorry. I wish I could help you more.

A friendly exorcist? As opposed to what, a mean one?
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Some exorcists banish spirits, but I try to help them.
My job is to figure out why they're there and help them with their earthly desires.
<<setSpeaker Harper>>
Don't tell me...
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I'm here to exorcise your mom.
