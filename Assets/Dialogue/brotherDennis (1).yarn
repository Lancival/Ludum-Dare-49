You got the parts for the boat yet?
I need a steering wheel, cables, and a rotary helm.
<<endif>>
<<if $hasSteeringWheel and $hasRotaryHelm and $hasCables is true>>
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
You found them!
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Delilah had the parts around here.
I think she meant to give these to you.
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
She did? I thought she forgot about the boat altogether. 
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Maybe she was hoping to surprise you.
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
It's crazy. She's been dead for a month, but I'm still learning new things about her.
I'd never have thought our relationship would keep changing after she passed.
Thank you.
If I discover mermaids, I will credit you!

<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
Is that...a person? Miss, are you lost?
You don't want to be wandering here alone.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Do you know Delilah Anderson?
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
You could say that. I'm her brother.
Let me guess, you're one of her fans.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I was wondering if you could tell me about when you saw her last
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
Look, I know you're up to no good. Tell me, why are you here?

She was always very quiet.
We were close as kids. We used to talk about our dreams â€”
I wanted to be a fisherman, she wanted to be a writer, as you can imagine.
I used to play hide and seek with her during family gatherings.
I'd seek, she'd hide, so she didn't have to talk about herself to everyone.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
But there has to be a reason she's still here. She has regrets from her life.
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
...My parents.
They made her sign up for theater, group dance classes, whatever they could to get her with other people.
They didn't know how to love her.
Delilah started getting known for her writing, and my parents were shocked.
We had no idea she was so good. She hit a million sales for her book.
Then she became poet laureate.
Suddenly, she was the breadwinner for a family who didn't give her much attention.
As she became more well known, we became more distant. She had to chase her dreams.
I don't think she was a very happy person. These past few years...
She's fallen off the deep end.

Don't tell me you're trying to bring her back to life or some other voodoo crap.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
A friendly exorcist's job is to remove ghosts, not bring them back.
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
"Friendly exorcist"? That's a first.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I think the reason her spirit is still here has something to do with you.
I know you've felt her presence here.
I can help you reach her.
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
Yeah, right.
You're really something for giving an old man false hope.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Haven't you felt something off about this place?
Have you heard any noises? Screams?
They sound like Delilah, right?
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
...How did you know that?
<<setSpeaker MC>>
They're coming from her house. I think she's trying to talk to us.
Can you tell me more about your relationship with Delilah?
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
There's no way Delilah would be screaming.

I don't know who you are, which means you don't know my sister.
I don't have the mental capacity to deal with another one of her crazed readers right now.

We grew up in a small town.
We weren't exactly rich.
My parents wanted us to pursue medicine or law;
she didn't care what they thought and left, and they didn't talk for years.
Imagine how she felt when my parents wrote letters of apology once they saw her name in the news.
Delilah had money - she was seen as our generation's voice - and they wanted their share.
I don't think she ever let that resentment go away.

She called me in the middle of the night saying she needed her husband and kids.
That she needed me.
She told me how much she loved and missed me.
Started talking about the boat, how we shouldn't give up on becoming sailors.
She started repeating that there wasn't enough time.
I think you're onto something about her spirit being trapped here.

She refused to do a book tour or go to any writing events. 
She didn't like the attention.
She had a P.O. box where fans could send her letters.
Delilah was embarrassed when people would compliment her writing,
but there was this one package that she cherished.
It was a letter from a woman who had moved to America as a kid.
She said she had trouble communicating, but reading Delilah's poetry helped her learn English.

<<setSpeaker MC>>
And what about you? How do you feel about her?
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
Well, I brought this boat here.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
Boat?
<<setSpeaker Dennis>>
I know it's stupid. But she promised me we'd fix this up.
Our childhood dream was to go sailing.
We wanted to be the first ones to discover mermaids.
The steering system is broken.
Figure she needs a new wheel, cables, and rotary helm.
I guess Delilah never got to it.
I wanted her to see the boat, even though she isn't here anymore.
<<setSpeaker MC>>
I may be able to help you...
